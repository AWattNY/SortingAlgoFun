# Intro
Welcome to my brief introduction to sorting algorithms!

To get get started, from the command line, please run 
```
npm install 
```

After all dependencies have installed, please run the following.
```
npm test 
```
Observe that many tests are currently failing. Work though helper functions found in `/src/helpers` to make the tests pass.

# Motivation
BubbleSort, mergeSort, and quickSort are the three sort most likely to be appear in interview questions. Behind the scenes, Javascript's V8 engine uses a version of quickSort to implement its native array sort method. Strong familiarity with at least these algorithms, and potentially insertionSort, will provide a solid foundation in sorting.
